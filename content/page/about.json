  "mission_statement": "I hope to bring a small batch, hand crafted kind of quality to anything from weddings to game day. My goal is that the taste speaks for itself. The bark is crispy, the meat is juicy and tender, and the flavor is a combo of real hardwood smoke, simple seasoning and above all made with diligence, passion, and care. ",
  "history": "Thanks for stopping by! JM BBQ started when I convinced my wife to let me buy a small capacity, 1/4 steel offset smoker. Over time, I learned how to control a real, open fire fueled by real hard wood. I was kicking leftovers to friends and when I realized that there was a growing demand for authentic, Texas-style barbecue in our neck of the woods, we upped our game and got a 250 gallon offset smoker, built right outside Dallas, Texas (Go Cowboys). All those nights and early mornings of learning how to control fire, render good smoke, and cook our various meats to a craftsman standard were translated to our new cooker and we were off! We take serious pride in our Brisket, but you'll find all our meats are tender and packed with flavor. Don't sleep on our revolving, craft sides either...they tie it all together! Much love!",

  "process": "Our process is simple: Hand Crafted! This begins by sourcing quality, certified beef and pork products. We are looking for things like coloration and fat content as we inspect the meat we purchase and cook. We use our own handmade slather that is specially made for our different meats and we top it with a Texas-inspired seasoning mix. From there, we see the meat through the multiple hours it will spend in our off-set smoker. We meticulously steward our white oak fire to achieve a faint blue smoke that renders that subtle, yet perfect smoke flavor and bark. \n \n Weâ€™ll cater most events! In our highly relational and personalized process, we will help you determine exactly how best we can serve you. From there, we will remain on site throughout your event cutting the meat, serving the sides, and filling stomachs.",
