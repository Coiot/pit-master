  "mission_statement": "I hope to bring a small batch, hand crafted kind of quality to anything from weddings to game day. My goal is that the taste speaks for itself. The bark is crispy, the meat is juicy and tender, and the flavor is a combo of real hardwood smoke, simple seasoning and above all made with diligence, passion, and care. ",
  "history": "Thanks for stopping by! I wanted to give you all a quick intro into how JM BBQ came to be. I have always been into grilling. From the first cheap Weber grill I purchased 14 yrs ago to the Big Green Egg my wife and I were gifted as a wedding present, it has been a quest to discover how best to achieve that killer bite-thru meat that dissolves in your mouth. Along the way, I got into briskets. Then I got into offset smoking. Soon, I was addicted and found myself thinking early and often about my next cook and going over the different techniques I would try in order to achieve the bombest smoked meat I could. I would often use my friends and family as guinea pigs to gauge where I was at and in the process discovered how much I loved cooking for others. I loved it so much so that I decided to just put myself out there, plunge into my passion, and start a small catering and made-to-order business.",
  "process": "Our process is simple: Hand Crafted! This begins by sourcing quality, certified beef and pork products. We are looking for things like coloration and fat content as we inspect the meat we purchase and cook. We use our own handmade slather that is specially made for our different meats and we top it with a Texas-inspired seasoning mix. From there, we see the meat through the multiple hours it will spend in our off-set smoker. We meticulously steward our white oak fire to achieve a faint blue smoke that renders that subtle, yet perfect smoke flavor and bark. \n \n Weâ€™ll cater most events! In our highly relational and personalized process, we will help you determine exactly how best we can serve you. From there, we will remain on site throughout your event cutting the meat, serving the sides, and filling stomachs.",
